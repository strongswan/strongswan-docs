The {PLAYSTORE}[strongSwan VPN Client for Android] is an app that can be installed
directly from {PLAYSTORE}[Google Play]. The app is also available via
{FDROID}[F-Droid] and the APKs are also on our {DOWNLOAD}[download server].

== Client Configuration

Since version xref:#_1_8_0_2017_01_20[1.8.0] of the app it is possible to import
xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[VPN profiles] from files.

Since version xref:#_2_5_0_2024_02_22[2.5.0] managed configurations are
supported via enterprise mobility management (EMM). This allows pushing VPN
profiles to managed devices using basically the same settings as those in the
xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[profile files]. But also provides additional
options to configure global app settings and disable certain features of the app
(e.g. the ability for users to add or import their own VPN profiles). Note that
distributing certificates with managed profiles requires the MDM to assign the
`CERT_INSTALL` delegated scope to the strongSwan app so it can install the
certificate and private key.

Client certificates and keys, and CA certificates may be added by bundling them
into a xref:pki/pkiQuickstart.adoc#_pkcs12_container[PKCS#12 file] and then
importing that file into the Android system keystore. CA certificates and server
certificates may also be imported directly into the app since
xref:#_1_4_0_2014_07_22[1.4.0].
Importing CA certificates into the Android system keystore may trigger a warning
since Android 4.4 ({GOOGLE}[Network may be monitored by an unknown third party])
whereas importing CA certificates directly into the app will work fine.

Since xref:#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0] split tunneling may be configured on the
client (i.e. to only route specific traffic via VPN and/or to exclude certain
traffic from the VPN). The client always proposes `*0.0.0.0/0*` as remote traffic
selector and narrowing performed by the server still applies.
Since xref:#_1_5_0_2015_07_28[1.5.0] the user may opt to block all traffic not
destined for the VPN if the server does narrow the traffic selector or split
tunneling is configured on the client.

Since xref:#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0] it is possible to limit a VPN connection to
specific apps or exclude certain apps from using the VPN (to them it will seem as
if no VPN is present).

Since xref:#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[2.0.0] an optional Quick Settings tile (Android 7+)
shows the current connection status and allows connecting/terminating the current
VPN connection easily. The same version brought support for the Always-on VPN
feature that may be enabled in the system's VPN settings on Android 7+ and will
start the VPN profile after a reboot (refer to the
xref:#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[changelog] for potential caveats). The default VPN profile
used for these two features may be configured in the app's global settings (the
default is to initiate the most recently used profile).

The app allows creating shortcuts on the Android Launcher to quickly initiate
specific VPN profiles.

Since xref:#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[2.0.0] it's possible to use *Intents* and a VPN
profile's UUID to connect/terminate it with automation apps such as Llama or
Tasker e.g. based on location, WiFi hotspots or other events.

How-to use *Intents* to connect or terminate VPN profiles:
[%collapsible]
====
The UUID required for this can be found at the bottom of the advanced settings
when editing a profile and may be copied from there.

To connect a profile use the following information in the Intent:

* `*Package*: org.strongswan.android`

* `*Action* : org.strongswan.android.action.START_PROFILE`

* `*Extras*` :
** `*org.strongswan.android.VPN_PROFILE_ID*`: UUID of the profile to start +
    (a string that looks like this: `7b21d354-52ed-4c14-803a-a3370f575405`)

* `*Target*: Activity`

To disconnect the profile use the following information in the Intent:

* `*Package*: org.strongswan.android`

* `*Action*: org.strongswan.android.action.DISCONNECT`

* `*Extras*`:
** `*org.strongswan.android.VPN_PROFILE_ID*`: UUID of the profile to disconnect

* `*Target*: Activity`

NOTE: If no profile ID is passed or it doesn't match the ID of the currently
      connected profile, a dialog is shown that asks confirmation from the user
      to disconnect the currently connected profile.
====

== Server Configuration

The app is compatible to the xref:interop/windowsClients.adoc[Windows example configurations]
we provide (although the app supports stronger algorithms than Windows clients
do, so adding additional algorithms or `default` to the configured proposals is
advised).

Since strongSwan version 5.2.1 and version xref:#_1_4_5_2014_11_06[1.4.5] of the
app, `*connections.<conn>.fragmentation = yes*` may be added to the server
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[configuration] to use IKEv2 fragmentation which
avoids problems with IP fragmentation during connection establishment (mainly due
to large certificates or a lot of certificate requests).

NOTE: The hostname/IP of the VPN server as configured in the VPN profile has to
      be contained as a `*subjectAltName*` extension in the VPN server's
      certificate. Since xref:#_1_6_0_2016_05_02[1.6.0] the server identity may
      also be configured explicitly.

== Known Limitations/Issues

 * Only IKEv2 is supported

 * Client authentication is limited to:
   * EAP authentication based on username/password (EAP-MSCHAPv2, EAP-MD5, EAP-GTC)
   * RSA/ECDSA authentication with private key/certificate
   * EAP-TLS with private key/certificate, see xref:#_1_4_5_2014_11_06[1.4.5]
     for limitations

 * The server always has to be authenticated with RSA/ECDSA (even when using
   EAP-TLS, see xref:#_1_4_5_2014_11_06[1.4.5]

 * PSK authentication is *not* supported, as it is potentially very dangerous
   because the client might send the hash of a weak password to a rogue VPN server.
   Thus we prefer EAP authentication where the server is first authenticated by
   an X.509 certificate and only afterwards the client uses its password.

 * Only a single tunnel can be established at a time

 * The IPsec default proposals are limited to AES encryption with SHA2/SHA1 data
   integrity or AES-GCM authenticated encryption. Optionally, using PFS with one
   of a number of proposed ECP/MODP DH groups. Since xref:#_1_7_0_2016_12_08[1.7.0]
   `*ChaCha20/Poly1305*` authenticated encryption and `*Curve25519*`-based DH is
   also supported and proposed. And since xref:#_1_9_5_2017_11_17[1.9.5] a custom
   ESP proposal may be configured.

 * Since the app runs with reduced privileges (it can't open `RAW/PACKET` sockets),
   it is limited to use UDP-encapsulated ESP, which it sends/receives via the UDP
   sockets used for IKE. So UDP-encapsulation is
   xref:features/natTraversal.adoc#_udp_encapsulation_of_esp[always enforced] even
   if there is no NAT between client and server, by sending a random NAT-D payload.

 * The above has implications regarding IPv6. Because the Linux kernel only
   supports UDP-encapsulation for ESP for IPv6 since 5.8, many servers might not
   support this yet.  Therefore, while IPv6 is always supported inside the
   tunnel (if appropriate virtual IPs and traffic selectors are negotiated),
   support for IPv6 transport addresses for IKE and ESP has to be enabled
   explicitly (per connection, available since xref:#_2_3_1_2020_10_29[2.3.1]).

 * The app is not compatible with Google's {PROJECTFI}[Project Fi] which provides
   its own always-on VPN connection. To use the app, the {PROJECTFI}[Project Fi]'s
   always-on VPN has to be disabled first using the following procedure:
+
[%collapsible]
====
** In `Settings` click `Google`
** Click `Network`
** Turn off the `Wi-Fi Assistant` setting
** Restart the device
----
Then turn off the always-on VPN connection:
----
** In `Settings` click `More` under `Wireless & Networks`
** Click `VPN`
** Click the gear next to the `Wi-Fi Assistant`
** Make sure `Always On` is not active
====

 * If you don't get a list of installed apps to exclude/include from the VPN you
   might have to explicitly allow the strongSwan app to get this list. For instance
   on the Huawei Mate 9 via `Phone Manager > Permissions`.

 * It might be necessary to exclude the app from any battery saver feature on the
    system (e.g. on the Xiaomi MIUI8).

 * Apps that create a screen overlay such as `Twilight` or `Night Mode` might
   interfere with the dialog to grant the app permission to create a VPN connection
   (unable to tap `OK/Grant`). If that's the case, temporarily disable any such app
   or if possible, whitelist/exclude the `VPNDialogs` system app from this feature.

 * If you have problems with the app, find bugs or have feature requests you may
   open a new {GITHUB}/issues[issue report] (please use the search function first
   to avoid duplicates). You may also send us the log file via email directly from
   within the app.

== Beta Testing

Sometimes we publish beta versions of our app on Google Play. If you'd like to try
new features and provide us with valuable feedback, please {PLAYTEST}[opt-in here]
or directly from the app's page in the Play store.

== Changelog

=== 2.5.5 (2025-04-04)

* Fix initiating managed profiles as Always-on VPN

=== 2.5.4 (2025-02-27)

* Fix reauthentication and roaming between networks (when MOBIKE isn't available)
  by explicitly disabling make-before-break reauthentication, which the app
  currently can't handle

=== 2.5.3 (2025-02-20)

* Add support for distributing passwords in managed profiles
* Add support for importing xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[profile files]
  with passwords (a warning is displayed to remind users that the file contains
  the password in cleartext)
* Fix a crash when editing the password of a managed profile
* Fix a crash when re-importing an already existing profile from a file
* Fix some deprecation warnings

=== 2.5.2 (2024-08-06)

* Increased target SDK to Android 14 and fixed compatibility issues
* Due to {A14ISSUE}[a bug in Android 14+], a new permission (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`)
  is necessary to start a VPN profile in the background from the status tile. If
  necessary, the app opens the settings dialog where users have to search the
  app and then grant the permission manually (Google disabled the possibility
  to directly ask for this permission some versions ago)
* Fix a crash when listing installed apps for new profiles

=== 2.5.1 (2024-02-26)

* Fix for existing shortcuts and automation via Intents

=== 2.5.0 (2024-02-22)

* Support for managed configurations via enterprise mobility management (EMM)

=== 2.4.2 (2023-08-29)

* Increased target SDK to Android 13 and ask for permission to show status notification
* Enable hardware acceleration in OpenSSL
* Use a more stable approach to determine source IP

=== 2.4.1 (2023-02-17)

* Changed the order of KE methods so that `ecp256` is again proposed first and
  in the KE payload instead of `curve25519`. This avoids issues with Zyxel
  Firewalls that can't handle KE payloads with an identifier larger than
  21 (`ecp521`) -- the identifier for `curve25519` is 31 -- and just silently
  drop such IKE_SA_INIT requests.

=== 2.4.0 (2023-02-13)

* Switched from BoringSSL to OpenSSL, which adds the following algorithms:
  Curve448 ECDH, AES-CCM, Camellia (CBC/CTR/XCBC), SHA-3 (HMAC/PKCS#1)

* Fixed an issue that caused file descriptor leaks when fetching OCSP/CRLs

* Improved translation for simplified Chinese

* Correctly included Ukrainian translation

* Increased minimum SDK version to 21 (Android 5.0)

=== 2.3.3 (2021-07-13)

* Adds a button to install user certificates (newer Android releases don't provide
  one in the selection dialog anymore - if no certs are installed, the dialog
  doesn't even show up).

* DNS servers are now explicitly applied whenever a TUN device is created (instead
  of only when the IKE_SA is established), this ensures that the correct DNS servers
  are used if the CHILD_SA gets explicitly deleted by the server and recreated by
  the client.

* Requests a new permission on Android 11 to get a list of all installed apps in
  order to exclude/include them from VPNs (and for the EAP-TNC use case).

=== 2.3.2 (2020-12-02)

* Don't mark VPN connections as metered. The default changed when targeting Android
  10 with the last release.

=== 2.3.1 (2020-10-29)

* Adds support to use IPv6 transport addresses for IKE and ESP. This can only be
  enabled if UDP encapsulation for IPv6 is supported by the server. Note that the
  Linux kernel only supports this since version 5.8, so many servers will not
  support it yet.

* Shows a proper error message if the UUID in a
  xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[profile] is invalid (e.g. contains no
  dashes).

* Fixes a potential crash with the power whitelist dialog and handles rotation and
  other Activity restarts better if the information dialog is shown

* Fixes the port scanning IMC (was broken since about
  xref:#_1_6_1_2016_05_04[1.6.1]).

=== 2.3.0 (2020-06-02)

* Several changes try to improve reachability even in Android's deep sleep phases.
** An Android-specific scheduler (based on AlarmManager) and whitelisting from
   the system's battery optimization (the user is automatically asked to do so)
   ensures the app is woken at the scheduled times, which ensure that events (in
   particular for NAT keepalives) are triggered accurately.
** DPDs are sent if no NAT keepalive has been sent for a while.
** DPDs are sent after address/routing changes even if the path to the peer stays
   the same.
** Lifetimes are slightly increased to avoid conflicts even with inaccurate
   scheduling (IKE_SA overtime is now 30m instead of 10m, CHILD_SA lifetime is 2.5h
   instead of 1h, rekeyings are initiated ~30m before that).

* Fixes the app icon on Android < 5.0.

* Fixes a possible crash via QuickSettings tile on some devices

=== 2.2.1 (2019-11-19)

* Fixes loading CRL/OCSP via HTTP on Android 9, which defaults to HTTPs only.

=== 2.2.0 (2019-10-15)

* Makes the client identity configurable (via advanced settings and
  xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[profiles]) also when using EAP authentication.
** The certificate identity is now configured using the same text field (with
   auto-completion for SANs) instead of a drop-down field (just leave it empty to
   use the certificate's subject DN as identity).

* Fixes an issue with ECDSA certificate selection on Android 10.
** Note that Android 10 doesn't show the dialog (with a button to install certs)
  if no certificates are found. Installation has to happen via
  xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[profile] or externally.

* Fixes an issue with break-before-make reauthentication (used if MOBIKE is not
  supported) if the server concurrently deletes the IKE_SA.

* Uses a different API (`*ConnectivityManager.registerNetworkCallback*` instead
  of the deprecated `*ConnectivityManager.CONNECTIVITY_ACTION*`) to detect network
  changes on Android 7 and newer.

* Fixes a potential crash on Huawei devices

=== 2.1.1 (2019-04-24)

* Authentication via EAP-MSCHPv2 now supports UTF-8 encoded passwords.

* Fixes an issue with upgrades from older versions.

=== 2.1.0 (2019-03-14)

* Adds a copy command to duplicate an existing VPN profile.

* Allows configuring custom DNS servers for each VPN profile.

=== 2.0.2 (2018-10-17)

* Fixes potential DNS leaks caused by a {TRACKER}/116257079[bug] in Android 9.

* Fixes clicking some buttons (certificate selection, app selection) with keyboard
  navigation (also affects e.g. Fire TV sticks) when running on Android < 8.

* Fixes an issue with the QuickSettings tile on some devices where the callback
  is called even if no tile is available.

* Fixes profile selection/edit when the device is rotated.

=== 2.0.1 (2018-07-04)

* Removes support for EAP-PEAP/TTLS as it caused major issues with commercial VPN
  services (one issue was that the server identity was initially enforced as AAA
  identity, but changing that revealed that some providers use self-signed AAA
  server certificates - not sure what clients accept that), hopefully proper
  support can be added in a future version.

* Fixes a possible crash related to Android 8's optional Autofill feature
  (the {TRACKER}/67675432[bug] that causes it was apparently fixed with Android
  8.1 but has not been backported).

=== 2.0.0 (2018-07-03)

* Supports the Always-on VPN feature on Android 7+.
** Android 8 only starts the VPN service after the user has unlocked the device
   after a reboot.
** Android 7 immediately starts the VPN service after booting, but that means the
   app has no access to the KeyChain yet (if certificates are used), so no VPN
   connection can be established until the user unlocks the device.
** If password authentication is used and the password is not stored in the profile,
   the connection is aborted and the user has to manually retry connecting to enter
   the password.
** The "Block connections without VPN" system option on Android 8+ blocks all
   traffic not sent via VPN without considering any subnets/apps that are excluded
   from a VPN (i.e. that feature is not compatible with split-tunneling).

* Adds a Quick Settings tile on Android 7+ to quickly initiate/terminate the VPN
  connection.
** Similar to the Always-on feature, Android 8 doesn't enable the Quick Settings
   tile until the user unlocked the device after a reboot.
** Disconnecting via tile from the lock screen requires the user to unlock the
   device, connecting is possible without (unless a password has to be entered).

* The new settings activity allows specifying a default VPN profile used for the
  two features above (the default is to initiate the most recently used profile).

* The app automatically tries to reconnect the VPN profile if fatal errors occur
  (e.g. authentication failures). The retries are delayed by an exponential backoff
  which is currently capped at 2 minutes.
** The status screen in the main activity as well as the notification show a
   countdown until the next automatic retry, manually retrying is possible from
   both locations.

* On Android 5+ a dummy VPN interface is installed while connecting to a VPN profile
  or recovering from errors, to block unencrypted traffic while taking excluded
  subnets/apps configured in the profile into account.
** Note that this VPN interface is removed when the VPN is disconnected.

* Errors are not shown in a modal dialog anymore in the main activity but in a
  banner directly above the status information (with buttons to view the log and
  retry connecting).

* Uses a separate activity to initiate/terminate/retry VPN profiles which avoids
  having to bring the main Activity to the foreground for these actions.

* Adds options to disable OCSP/CRL fetching (e.g. if it's known the server is not
  available, or if CRLs are too large).

* Adds an option to enable strict revocation checking via OCSP/CRL. If enabled,
  the authentication will fail if the revocation status of the server certificate
  is unknown (e.g. because no valid CRL is available).

* Fetching OCSP/CRL can now be aborted immediately (e.g. to cancel connecting if
  an OCSP server is not reachable).

* Basic support for EAP-TTLS/EAP-PEAP has been added but had to be removed again
  with xref:#_2_0_1_2018_07_04[2.0.1].

* Adds an option to use PSS encoding for RSA signatures instead of the classic
  PKCS#1 encoding.

* The explicit ESP proposals for the deprecated Suite B have been removed.

* Adds more clear error messages if permission for VPNs can't be acquired (e.g.
  because another app has the Always-on VPN feature enabled).

* The date/time/thread is shown in the log view if enough space is available (e.g.
  on tablets or even in landscape orientation on phones). It should also be more
  efficient when displaying large logs.

* Removes the MIME-type filter when importing trusted certificates, allowing the
  import of certificates even if they don't have an X.509 related MIME-type set.

* All VPN profiles now have a random UUID assigned (its value may be copied from
  the profile editor e.g. to initiate/terminate a VPN profile via explicit
  `*Intent*`).

=== 1.9.6 (2018-02-08)

* Always sends the client certificate (if applicable) instead of only after
  receiving a certificate request (allows servers that accept certificates from a
  lot of CAs to avoid sending certificate requests).

=== 1.9.5 (2017-11-17)

* Makes the IKE and/or ESP algorithms configurable.

* Removes `*modp1024*` from the default IKEv2 proposal. If the server only allows
  this DH group, a custom IKE proposal has to be configured in the VPN profile.

=== 1.9.4 (2017-09-18)

* Adds support for delta CRLs.

* Fixes issues with fragmented IP packets ({GITHUB}/pull/80[pull request #80]).

* Ensures expires are triggered for the correct IPsec SA.

* Fixes an issue with multicast addresses when using split tunneling on older
  Android releases.

* Does not consider a DH group mismatch as failure anymore as responder of a
  CHILD_SA rekeying
  ({GITHUB}/commit/e7276f78aae95905d9dfe7ded485d6771c4fcaa0[commit e7276f78aa]).

=== 1.9.3 (2017-09-04)

* Adds support to verify server certificates via OCSP (Online Certificate Status
  Protocol).

* Caches CRLs in the app directory.

* The CRL cache may be cleared via main menu.

* Adds a button to reconnect the VPN profile to the "currently connected" dialog.

* Don't apply/configure app selection on Android < 5 (the API is not supported
  there).

* Initiator SPIs are reset when retrying while reconnecting which might avoid
  issues with `*INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD*` notifies.

* Catches some random exceptions (as seen in Play Console)

=== 1.9.2 (2017-07-04)

* Fixes a crash on Android <= 5.

* Fixes database update when updating from app versions < 1.8.0.


=== 1.9.1 (2017-07-03)

* Fixes a crash with pre-existing profiles.

=== 1.9.0 (2017-07-03)

* Adds support for split-tunneling on the client (only route specific traffic via
  VPN and/or exclude specific traffic from the VPN).

* Adds support for per-app VPN (either allow only specific apps to use the VPN or
  exclude certain apps from using it).

* Sending of certificate requests may be disabled (while this allows reducing the
  size of the IKE_AUTH message, e.g. if fragmentation is not supported. It only
  works if the server also sends its certificate if it didn't receive any
  certificate requests).

* NAT-T keepalive interval is now configurable.

* xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[VPN profiles] may be imported via SAF
  (Storage Access Framework) and allow the configuration of the new settings.

* CRLs are now fetched with a simple Android-specific HTTP[S] fetcher.

* Adds a disconnect button in the permanent notification.

* The log view should now be more efficient.

* Fixes the handling of backslashes in usernames.

* Adds a Traditional Chinese translation.

=== 1.8.2 (2017-02-20)

* Fixes an issue while disconnecting on certain devices.

=== 1.8.1 (2017-02-07)

* Adds Simplified Chinese translation.

=== 1.8.0 (2017-01-20)

* Adds support to import xref:./androidVpnClientProfiles.adoc[VPN profiles] from
  JSON-encoded files.

=== 1.7.2 (2016-12-10)

* Re-adds support for the ECC Brainpool DH groups (BoringSSL doesn't provide these).

=== 1.7.1 (2016-12-09)

* Fixes a crash (regarding `*libtpmtss.so*`) on older Android systems.

=== 1.7.0 (2016-12-08)

* Adds a permanent notification while connected (or connecting) that shows the
  current status and which allows running the VpnService instance as foreground
  service. This in turn should prevent Android from terminating it when low on
  memory.

* Supports the `*ChaCha20/Poly1305*` AEAD and `*Curve25519*` DH algorithms.

* Properly validates entered server port and MTU values in the GUI.

* Logs the installed DNS servers.

* Uses BoringSSL instead of OpenSSL.

* Based on strongSwan version 5.5.1.

=== 1.6.2 (2016-05-06)

* Fixes a crash when importing CA/server certificates via SAF (Storage Access
  Framework).

=== 1.6.1 (2016-05-04)

* Fixes an interoperability issue with Windows Server. strongSwan version 5.4.0
  changed the order of the algorithms in the default IKE proposal.  Algorithms
  that provide a security of less than 128-bit were moved to the end of the list.
  Now Windows Server 2012 R2 (in its default configuration at least) only supports
  `*modp1024*`. The problem is that Microsoft's IKEv2 implementation only seems to
  consider the first fifteen algorithms of a specific transform type in the
  proposal. Because strongSwan supports quite a lot of DH groups and due to the
  reordering, `*modp1024*` was now at position 17 in the proposal. This meant
  that Microsoft Server rejected the IKE_SA_INIT message with a
  `NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN` error. This has been fixed by removing some of the weaker
  and rarely used DH groups from the default proposal
 ({GITHUB}/commit/fae18fd201eb0b2e9a437a9e1b6faf52afd784f8[commit fae18fd201]).

* Also corrects the label for the password field in the login dialog.

=== 1.6.0 (2016-05-02)

* Based on version:5.4.0, which e.g. adds support for IKEv2 redirection.

* Configuration of the server identity. If it is set the identity is sent as `*IDr*`
  during authentication and must match the server's identity exactly (i.e. it
  disables loose identity matching against all `*subjectAltNames*`).

* Selection of the client identity if certificate authentication is used.

* GUI changes:
** Removed the progress dialogs during connecting/disconnecting.
** Redesign of the profile editor (reordered, floating labels, helper texts
   "gateway"->"server").
** Tabs in CA certificate manager have been updated (sliding tabs with ViewPager).
** Switched to the AppCompat theme (Material-like).

* Increases the NAT-T keepalive interval to 45s. No attempt to send keepalives is
  made anymore if there is no connectivity.

* Fixed the font in the log view on Android 5+.

* Native 64-bit build.

=== 1.5.0 (2015-07-28)

* Based on version 5.3.2.

* Roaming between networks on Android 5 and newer has been fixed.

* Adds new advanced profile settings:
** A custom MTU can be specified (currently between 1280 and 1500).
** The server port can be changed (default is 500, with a switch to 4500 - there
   is no switch if a custom port is set).
** Split tunneling can be disabled by blocking all traffic that is not destined
   for the VPN.
*** Only on Android 5 and newer will split tunneling fully work if only one address
    family is tunneled via VPN.

* Sets the preferred language for remediation instructions to the system language.

* EAP-TNC does not require a client certificate anymore.

* Fixes a linker issue on Android M.

=== 1.4.6 (2015-06-08)

* Fix for
 {BLOG}/2015/06/08/strongswan-vulnerability-(cve-2015-4171).html[CVE-2015-4171].

=== 1.4.5 (2014-11-06)

* Based on version 5.2.1 including improved MOBIKE handling and support for IKEv2
  fragmentation.

* Enables optional PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) for IPsec SAs. Proposed are cipher
  suites with and without DH groups, so it's up to the VPN server whether PFS is
  used or not.

* Adds basic support for EAP-TLS. Limitations are:
** EAP-only authentication is not allowed because the AAA identity is not
   configurable. So to prevent anyone with a valid certificate from impersonating
   the AAA server and thus the VPN server, the server is authenticated with a
   certificate (like we do with other authentication methods).
** It's currently not possible to select a specific CA certificate to authenticate
   the AAA server certificate, so it either must be issued by the same CA as that
   of the VPN server or automatic CA certificate selection must be enabled in the
   VPN profile.

=== 1.4.0 (2014-07-22)

* Adds the ability to import CA and server certificates directly into the app. On
  Android 4.4+ the {SAF}[SAF] (Storage Access Framework) is used to allow users to
  browse for certificate files (if the MIME-type is not set properly the advanced
  view has to be used to see all files). On older systems the files may be opened
  from third-party file managers.

* The GUI indicates if the connection is being reestablished.

* A DNS proxy resolves the VPN server's hostname while reestablishing (plaintext
 is blocked otherwise).

* Supports ECDSA private keys on recent Android systems (tested on Android 4.4.4)

=== 1.3.4 (2014-04-25)

* Based on version 5.1.3 (fixes a security vulnerability).

* Links `*libcrypto*` (OpenSSL) statically.

* Doesn't limit the number of packets during EAP-TTLS.

=== 1.3.3 (2013-11-13)

* Based on version 5.1.1.

* Fixed issues with IV generation and padding length calculation for AES-GCM.

* Removes the `*Vstr*` dependency.

=== 1.3.2 (2013-09-26)

* Fixed a regression causing remediation instructions to pile up (EAP-TNC).

=== 1.3.1 (2013-09-23)

* Improved recovery after certain connectivity changes.

=== 1.3.0 (2013-07-08)

* Added support for EAP-TNC.

* Disabled listening on IPv6 because the Linux kernel currently does not support
  UDP encapsulation of ESP packets for IPv6.

=== 1.2.3 (2013-05-03)

* Added support for AES-GCM.

* Support for IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels.

* Uses `*kernel-netlink*` to handle interface/IP address enumeration.

=== 1.2.2 (2013-03-07)

* Added support for multiple authentication, e.g. based on an X.509 certificate
  followed by EAP ({RFC4739}[RFC 4739]).

* Added Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian translations.

* Fixed a race condition during reauthentication and a potential freeze while
  disconnecting.

=== 1.2.1 (2012-11-21)

* Added shortcuts to VPN profiles to quickly start specific connections from the
  launcher.

* Added a confirmation dialog if a connection is started but one is already
  established.

* Fixed a few Android 4.2 specific issues.

=== 1.2.0 (2012-10-18)

* Added support for MOBIKE e.g. allows switching between different interfaces
  (e.g. Wifi and 3G/4G).

* The app tries to keep the connection established until the user disconnects
  manually.

=== 1.1.3 (2012-09-24)

* Workaround for a private key issue on Android 4.1.

=== 1.1.2 (2012-09-18)

* Added loose ID matching: While the client expects the hostname/IP of the VPN
  server to be contained as `*subjectAltName*` in the certificate this allows the
  responder to use a different IDr than that, as long as it is confirmed by the
  certificate (the client does not send an IDr anymore).

=== 1.1.1 (2012-09-17)

* Fixed a Unicode issue when converting Java to C strings.

=== 1.1.0 (2012-09-06)

* Added certificate authentication and fixed reauthentication.
