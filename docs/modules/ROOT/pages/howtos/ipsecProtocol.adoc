The IP security (IPsec) protocol consists of two main components:

* The xref:#_encapsulating_security_payload_esp[Encapsulating Security Payload]
  (ESP) protocol securing the IP packets transferred between two IPsec endpoints.

* The xref:#_internet_key_exchange_version_2_ikev2[Internet Key Exchange Version 2]
  (IKEv2) auxiliary protocol responsible for the mutual authentication of the IPsec
  endpoints and the automated establishment of encryption and data integrity session
  keys for both the IKev2 management protocol itself and for the ESP payload
  protection.

We do not treat the authentication-only *Authentication Header* (AH) protocol
which is rarely used, especially because it is not suited for NAT traversal.

== Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

The *Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)* is defined in {RFC4303}[RFC 4303],
has IP protocol number `*50*` and doesn't have any ports. ESP allows the encryption
of *IP packets* on the network layer carrying e.g. Layer 4 TCP traffic

=== IPsec Transport Mode

In *IPsec Transport* mode the original IP header is retained and just the Layer 4
payload carried by the IP packet is encrypted. The ESP header is inserted between
the original IP header and the encrypted payload.

Originally intended for protecting direct IPv6 host-to-host connections, transport
mode is currently mainly used to secure the *Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol* (L2TP),
see {RFC3193}[RFC 3193].

=== IPsec Tunnel Mode

In *IPsec Tunnel* mode the complete IP packet is encapsulated by ESP and an outer
IP header is prepended:

=== ESP Packet Structure

An ESP packet consists of an ESP header, the encrypted IP payload body and an ESP
trailer needed for padding. The *Authentication Data* field appended at the end as
a cryptographic checksum guarantees *data integrity*.

image::espHeader.png[ESP Header]

The 32 bit *Security Parameters Index* (SPI) is used by the receiving IPsec peer
as an index into its kernel-based database to look up the session keys needed
to decrypt and authenticate the ESP packet. The SPI is also needed to determine the
IPsec security policy that has to be enforced on the inbound plaintext IP packets
after decryption.

== Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)

Version 2 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) protocol defined in {RFC7296}[RFC 7296]
manages the setup of IPsec connections. The IKEv2 auxiliary protocol uses UDP
datagrams with both source and destination ports set to the well-known UDP port `*500*`.

=== IKE_SA_INIT Request/Response

The *Initiator* starts the negotiation be sending an `IKE_SA_INIT` request which
is answered by the *Responder* with an `IKE_SA_INIT` response.

image::ikeSaInit.png[IKE_SA_INIT Request/Response Pair]

If the *Responder* comes to the conclusion that it is under a *Denial of Service*
(DoS) attack, it can request a *Cookie* from the *Initiator*  before sending the
computationally expensive *Key Exchange* (KE) payload in the `IKE_SA_INIT` response.
This effectively prevents IP spoofing.

Based on the exchange of the *Key Exchange* (KE) and *Nonces* (N) payloads in
`IKE_SA_INIT`, both endpoints can derive a *Shared Secret* which allows them to
encrypt all following IKE messages based on the `IKE_SA` established via the `SA1i`
and `SA1r` *Security Association* payloads.

=== IKE_AUTH Request/Response

==== Certificate-based Authentication

In the `ÌKE_AUTH` request the *Initiator* authenticates itself by sending its
identity `IDi` and a *Digital Signature* in the `AUTHi` payload accompanied by an
optional *Certificate* payload `CERTi`. The *Responder* verifies the validity and
trustworthiness of the received end entity certificate by going up the X.509 trust
chain until a locally stored Root CA certificate is reached.

Additionally the *Initiator* sends a *Security Association* proposal `SA2i` and a
set of *Traffic Selectors* `TSi` and `TSr` to be used for the first `CHILD_SA`.

image::ikeAuth.png[IKE_AUTH Request/Response Pair]

The *Responder* authenticates itself in turn with a *Digital Signature* in the
`AUTHr` payload accompanied by an optional *Certificate* payload `CERTr` contained
in the `IKE_AUTH` response and includes a selected *Security Association* `SA2r`
proposal and a possibly *narrowed* set of *Traffic Selectors* `TSi` and `TSr`.
With this information the `CHILD_SA` defining the encryption and data integrity
of the IPsec payload packets can be installed and activated.

==== PSK-based Authentication

If a *Pre-Shared Key* (PSK) is used for authentication then the `AUTHi` and `AUTHr`
payloads contain a hash over the exchanged IKEv2 messages and the pre-shared secret.

image::ikeAuthPsk.png[IKE_AUTH Request/Response Pair using PSK]

Since the *Initiator* is the first to send its password hash in the `AUTHi` payload,
this poses a serious security risk when the PSK is weak and is intercepted by an
active man-in-the-middle (MITM) who can then do an offline dictionary or brute force
attack on the `AUTHi` payload and potentially crack the password. Therefore we
strongly discourage the use of PSK-based authentication if a sufficient password
strength cannot be enforced.

==== EAP-based Authentication

In order to prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks possible with
xref:#_psk_based_authentication[PSK-based authentication], EAP-based authentication
has been introduced by the IKEv2 standard. If the *Initiator* doesn't include an
`AUTHi` payload in the `IKE_AUTH` request, the *Responder* sends its strong *Digital
Signature* in the `AUTHr` payload first, in order to establish trust and at the
same time initiates the EAP protocol by including a first EAP request in the `IKE_AUTH`
response.

image::ikeAuthEap.png[IKE_AUTH Request/Response Pair using EAP]

The *Initiator* can then use its PSK with EAP-MD5 or EAP-MSCHAPv2 to authenticate
itself to the trusted *Responder* over the encrypted IKEv2 channel.

=== CREATE_CHILD_SA Request/Response

`CREATE_CHILD_SA` request/response pairs are used to negotiate additional `CHILD_SAs`
or to do the periodic rekeying of either the `IKE_SA` or the `CHILD_SAs`.

image::createChildSa.png[CREATE_CHILD_SA Request/Response Pair]

Without the `N(REKEY_SA)` notification the `IKE_SA` is rekeyed, the fresh
*Key Exchange* (KE) payloads guaranteeing *Perfect Forward Secrecy* (PFS). With a
`N(REKEY_SA)` notification included, a `CHILD_SA` is rekeyed, the *Key Exchange*
(KE) payloads being optional.
