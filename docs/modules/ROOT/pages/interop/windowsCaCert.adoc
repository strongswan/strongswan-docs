= Storing a Windows CA Certificate

Windows clients using EAP-based authentication methods (e.g. EAP-TLS or EAP-MSCHAPv2)
require a Root CA certificate as format .p12 with key in the *Local Machine* store in order to be able to
put trust into the received server certificate and thus be able to verify the digital
signature sent by the VPN gateway in the `AUTH` payload of the `IKE_AUTH` response.

. Double-click on the CA certificate file to be imported and the
  *Certificate Information* pops up.

Since we need to import the CA certificate to be used for IKEv2 authentication
under the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` branch of the Windows registry, select *Local Machine*
as *Store Location*. Then click *Next*.

. After giving permission for the operation, the *Certificate Store* menu pops up.
