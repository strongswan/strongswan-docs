= Virtual IP Addresses

:TESTS: https://www.strongswan.org/testing/testresults6
:EX:    {TESTS}/ikev2/ip-two-pools-v4v6

IKEv1 and IKEv2 both know the concept of *virtual IP* addresses. This means that
the initiator requests an additional IP address from the responder to use as the
inner IPsec tunnel address.

In IKEv1, virtual IPs are exchanged using the `ModeConfig` extension. IKEv2 has
full support for virtual IPs in the core standard using `CP` Configuration Payloads.

strongSwan currently implements one scenario with IKEv2 configuration payloads,
where a virtual IP address is requested by the *initiator* and one or several
IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses are assigned from multiple pools by the *responder*.

An alterantive approach is possible by the IKEv2 protocol where the *responder*
would propose virtual IP addresses to the *initiator* but this is an uncommon
setup and therefore not supported. It is supported for IKEv1, though, with
`ModeConfig` in `*push*` mode.


== Initiator Configuration

To request an *arbitrary* virtual IP from the responder the client configures the
following in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]:

[cols="6,7"]
|===
|IPv4|IPv6

|`connections.<conn>.vips = 0.0.0.0`
|`connections.<conn>.vips = ::`
|===

It is possible to request a specific address by setting:

[cols="6,7"]
|===
|IPv4|IPv6

|`connections.<conn>.vips = 10.3.0.5`
|`connections.<conn>.vips = 2001:db8::1`
|===

However the responder may return a *different address*, or may *not return* one
at all.

To use a *specific and static* virtual IP (i.e. without exchanging any
configuration payloads) it may simply be added to any local interface (even `*lo*`)
and referenced in the client's local traffic selector (`*local_ts*`).
Configuring such an IP as in the example above will not have the intended effect
because the IP won't get xref:#_implementation[installed on the system] unless
the server actually assigns that IP to the client with a configuration payload.

The traffic selectors in `*local_ts*` and `*remote_ts*` default to the value
`*dynamic*`. If virtual IPs are used this value gets dynamically replaced by the
received or assigned virtual IP, respectively. Therefore, no local traffic selector
*must be* configured on the client and no remote traffic selector on the server
when using virtual IPs. This ensures the client's traffic selector is correctly
narrowed to the assigned virtual IP.

A client may request *multiple* IP addresses by listing multiple IP addresses in
`*connections.<conn>.vips*`. The main use case is for dual-stack hosts to request
a virtual IP of each address family:
----
connections.<conn>.vips = 0.0.0.0, ::
----

=== Example

=== DNS servers

VPN clients cannot explicitly request DNS servers via a special DNS option in
xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. But DNS server information received
from the VPN gateway through the `IKEv2` `CP` or `IKEv1` `ModeConfig` payloads
are handled for instance by the xref:plugins/resolve.adoc[`*resolve*`] plugin
which in turn uses either the `*resolvconf(8)*` utility to add the DNS server
information on the host or write it directly to `*/etc/resolv.conf`* or to an
alternative file specified with the `*--with-resolve-conf*`
xref:install/autoconf.adoc#_with_options[`*./configure*`] directive.

=== Implementation

On Linux the virtual IP addresses will be installed on the outbound interface by
default. The interface may be changed with the `*charon.install_virtual_ip_on*`
option. Source routes will be installed in the routing table configured with
`*charon.routing_table*` in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon[`*strongswan.conf*`] or via the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc#_with_options[`*./configure*`] option
`*--with-routing-table*`. The source routes force the use of the virtual IP when
sending packets to the subnets defined as remote traffic selector (if the physical
IP were used, the IPsec policies wouldn't match and the packets wouldn't get
tunneled).

== Responder Configuration

As already documented above, the remote traffic selector `*remote_ts*` defaults
to the value `*dynamic*`. This placeholder gets dynamically replaced by the
virtual IP assigned to a client. Therefore *no remote traffic selector must be
configured* on the server when using virtual IPs. This ensures the client's
traffic selector is correctly narrowed to the assigned virtual IP (otherwise,
every client would get the same traffic selector assigned, resulting in conflicting
policies).

To serve a specific IP address (even if the initiator requests a different address)
to a single client, the following may be configured:

[cols="6,7"]
|===
|IPv4|IPv6

|`connections.<conn>.pools = <name>`
|`connections.<conn>.pools = <name>`


|`pools.<name>.addrs = 10.3.0.5`
|`pools.<name>.addrs = 2001:db8::1`
|===

To serve *multiple clients*, define an address pool in CIDR notation

[cols="6,7"]
|===
|IPv4|IPv6

|`connections.<conn>.pools = <name>`
|`connections.<conn>.pools = <name>`

|`pools.<name>.addrs = 10.3.0.0/24`
|`pools.<name>.addrs = 2001:db8::3.0/24`
|===

or as an IP address range

[cols="6,7"]
|===
|IPv4|IPv6

|`connections.<conn>.pools = <name>`
|`connections.<conn>.pools = <name>`

|`pools.<name>.addrs = 10.3.0.1-10.3.0.100`
|`pools.<name>.addrs = 2001:db8::3.1-2001:db8::3.100`
|===

As address pools are explicitly assigned to connections defined in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`], multiple connections can easily
share the same pool.

It's also possible to use an external pool provided by a plugin by specifying a
pool name to request addresses from (see further below for details on these
backends):

 connections.<conn>.pools = poolname

This queries registered plugins for an IP address from a pool named `*poolname*`
(below are two examples that use the
xref:plugins/dhcp.adoc[`*dhcp*`] and xref:plugins/eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`]
plugins, respectively).

Multiple pools may be defined. Note that the order in which they are queried
primarily depends on the plugin order. Only if pools are provided by the same
backend, does the order defined in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]
matter:

 connections.<conn>.pools = v4pool, v6pool
 pools.v4pool.addrs = 10.3.0.0/24
 pools.v6pool.addrs = 2001:db8::3:0/24

=== DNS servers

DNS servers and other attributes can be assigned by plugins (e.g. by the
xref:plugins/attr.adoc[`*attr*`] plugin. In
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] each pool in the `*pools*`
section may define a list of attributes to assign to clients.

=== In-memory backend

A non-persistent memory-based backend is the default as described for
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. Such a backend is suitable for
environments where pools are not shared across multiple gateways, server restarts
are rare and direct administration of the pools is not needed (though there are
some provisions for non-destructively reloading pool configurations in a running
server when using xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]).  To preserve
IP address affinity, the remote IKE identity (as defined for the connection in
question) is used.  This maintains the same IP for a client (most of the time)
even across brief teardowns of connections, approximating the behavior of a DHCP
server without the stricture of lease expiry timers but prevents clients from
intentionally attempting to get a different IP address as there is no
corresponding release mechanism.

=== Database backend

The xref:tools/pool.adoc[`*pool*`] utility allows easy management of IP address
pools and other attributes, like DNS servers, stored in an SQL database using the
xref:plugins/attr-sql.adoc[`*attr-sql*`] plugin.

=== DHCP backend

With the xref:plugins/dhcp.adoc[`*dhcp*`] plugin the responder can request
virtual IP addresses for clients from a DHCP server using broadcasts or from a
designated server.

DNS/WINS server information is additionally served to clients if the DHCP server
provides such information.

The plugin is used by setting

 connections.<conn>.pools = dhcp

The xref:plugins/farp.adoc[`*farp*`] plugin might also be of use when using the
xref:plugins/dhcp.adoc[`*dhcp*`] plugin. It allows the responder to fake ARP
responses for virtual IP addresses handed out to clients. This lets a road-warrior
act as a client on the local LAN of the responder.

=== RADIUS backend

The xref:plugins/eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] plugin can provide virtual IP
addresses assigned to RADIUS clients via the `*Framed-IP-Address*` attribute.
xref:plugins/eap-radius.adoc#_radius_attribute_forwarding[Forwarding of other RADIUS attributes]
is also supported. The plugin is used by setting

 connections.<conn>.pools = radius

=== Multiple pools, Different Backends

If multiple pools are defined from *different* backends, for instance

 connections.<conn>.pools = radius, v4pool
 pools.v4pool.addrs = 10.3.0.0/24

the order in which they are queried for virtual IPs depends on the
xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc[plugin load order]. In-memory pools are provided by
the xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] plugins. The order `*pools*` is irrelevant
unless multiple in-memory pools from the same backend are defined.
