= Logrotate configuration 

When configuring loggint to a file by using the xref:config//logging.adoc#file-loggers[filelogger] it is desirable to have
a logroate configuration in place for the file in order to limit the size of the log file.

Following is an example logrotate configuration for keeping a single file.
```
/var/log/charon.log {
    missingok
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/swanctl --reload-settings
    endscript
    maxsize 10M
    create 0600 root root
    shred
    shredcycles 16
}
```

The following configuration is for a daily file.

```
/var/log/charon.log {
    missingok
    sharedscripts
    compress
    postrotate
        /usr/bin/swanctl --reload-settings
    endscript
    dateext
    dateyesterday
    delaycompress
    maxsize 10M
    compresscmd xz
    create 0600 root root
    shred
    shredcycles 16

```

These files are compatible with the following filelogger configuration:
```
charon {
       filelog {
                charon-log {
                        time_format = %a, %Y-%m-%d %R
                        path = /var/log/charon.log
                        default = 2
                        mgr = 0
                        net = 1
                        enc = 1
                        asn = 1
                        job = 1
                        knl = 2
                        ike_name = yes
                        append = yes
                        flush_line = yes
                }
        }
}
```
