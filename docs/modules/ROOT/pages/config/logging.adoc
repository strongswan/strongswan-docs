By default, the IKE xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] daemon logs via
`*syslog(3)*` using the facilities `*LOG_AUTHPRIV*` (only messages on log level
`*0*`) and `*LOG_DAEMON*` (all log levels). The default log level for all
subsystems is `*1*`.

Where the log messages eventually end up depends on how `*syslog*` is configured
on your system. Common places are `*/var/log/daemon*`, `*/var/log/syslog*` or
`*/var/log/messages*`.

Unlike xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`],
xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon-systemd*`] logs to the `*systemd*`
journal by default, not to `*syslog*`. The log levels are
configurable in a xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc#_logging[separate section]
in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] which is not described
here.

== Levels and Subsystems/Groups

The IKE daemon knows different numerical levels of logging ranging from `*-1*`to
`*4*`:

[cols="1,8"]
|===

|-1 |Absolutely silent

| 0 |Very basic auditing logs, (e.g. SA up/SA down)

| 1 |Generic control flow with errors, a good default to see whats going on

| 2 |More detailed debugging control flow

| 3 |Including RAW data dumps in hex

| 4 |Also include sensitive material in dumps, e.g. keys
|===

Each logging message also has a source from which subsystem in the daemon the
log came from:

[cols="1,8"]
|===

|`app` |applications other than daemons

|`asn` |Low-level encoding/decoding (ASN.1, X.509 etc.)

|`cfg` |Configuration management and plugins

|`chd` |CHILD_SA/IPsec SA

|`dmn` |Main daemon setup/cleanup/signal handling

|`enc` |Packet encoding/decoding encryption/decryption operations

|`esp` |libipsec library messages

|`ike` |IKE_SA/ISAKMP SA

|`imc` |Integrity Measurement Collector

|`imv` |Integrity Measurement Verifier

|`job` |Jobs queuing/processing and thread pool management

|`wch` |File descriptor watcher (logged in `job` prior to version 6.0.2)

|`knl` |IPsec/Networking kernel interface

|`lib` |libstrongswan library messages

|`mgr` |IKE_SA manager, handling synchronization for IKE_SA access

|`net` |IKE network communication

|`pts` |Platform Trust Service

|`tls` |libtls library messages

|`tnc` |Trusted Network Connect
|===

== Configuration in strongswan.conf

strongSwan provides a flexible configuration of the loggers in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]. There currently are two
types:

[cols="2,6"]
|===

|*File loggers*
|Log directly into a file. Configured in `*charon.filelog*` section

|*Syslog loggers*
|Log into a syslog facility. Configured in `*charon.syslog*` section
|===

Multiple loggers can be set up for each type, with different log verbosity for
the different subsystems of the daemon.

The logger configuration is reloaded if the daemon receives a `*SIGHUP*` signal
which causes the daemon to reload
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] and the plugins (since
version 5.5.2 this also works for
xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon-systemd*`]). Besides changing the
configuration this allows to easily rotate log files created by file loggers
without having to restart the daemon. Since version 5.5.2 the
xref:swanctl/swanctlReloadSettings.adoc[`*swanctl --reload-settings*`] command
also reloads the loggers, thus having the same functionality as sending a
`*SIGHUP*` signal.

The following options are supported for each logger:

=== File Loggers

NOTE: Since version 5.7.0, section names can't contain dots or colons. To specify
      such paths use the *path* setting in an arbitrarily named section.

NOTE: xref:config//logrotate.adoc[`*logrotate*`] contains two example configurations for logroate to manage a log file written by strongswan

*charon.filelog*

[cols="3,1,9"]
|===
|Key |Default |Description

|<name>.path          |
|The absolute path to the log file or stderr/stdout (since version 5.7.0).

|<name>.default       |`1`
|Specifies the default loglevel to be used for subsystems for which no specific
 loglevel is defined

|<name>.<subsystem>   |<default>
|Log level for a specific subsystem

|<name>.append        |`yes`
|If this option is enabled log entries are appended to the existing file

|<name>.flush_line    |`no`
|Enabling this option disables block buffering and enables line buffering, i.e.
 a flush to disk is enforced for each logged line

|<name>.ike_name      |`no`
|Add the connection name and a unique numerical identifier for the current
 IKE_SA to each log entry if available

|<name>.json          |`no`
|Enables writing each log entry as a JSON object to the file (since version 6.0.0).
 The properties are "time" (if `*time_format*` is set), "thread", "group",
 "level" and "msg". Newlines, double quotes and backslashes are escaped in the
 latter. If `*ike_name*` is enabled, "ikesa-uniqueid" and "ikesa-name" are added
 to the object if available. The `*log_level*` option does not apply if this is
 enabled. Since version 6.0.0

|<name>.log_level     |`no`
|Add the log level of each message after the subsystem (since version 5.9.1)

|<name>.time_format   |
|Prefix each log entry with a timestamp. The option accepts a format string as
 passed to {STRFTIME}[`*strftime(3)*`]

|<name>.time_precision|
|Add the milliseconds (`*ms*`) or microseconds (`*us*`) within the current second
 after the timestamp (separated by a dot, so `*time_format*` should end with
 `*%S*` or `*%T*`). By default, nothing is added. This replaces `*time_add_ms*`
 with version 6.0.0

|<name>.time_add_ms   |`no`
|Adds the milliseconds within the current second after the timestamp (separated
 by a dot so `*time_format*` should end with `*%S*` or `*%T*`). Deprecated since
 version 6.0.0, use `*time_precision*` instead
|===

_The placeholder `*<name>*` is an arbitrary name if `*path*` is specified and
otherwise either an absolute file path in the filesystem or one of `*stdout*`
or `*stderr*`._

=== Syslog Loggers

*charon.syslog*

[cols="3,1,9"]
|===
|Key |Default |Description

|identifier                |
|Global identifier used for an `*openlog(3)*` call prepended to each log message
 by `*syslog*`. If not configured, `*openlog(3)*` is not called. Thus the value
 will depend on system defaults (often the program name)

|<facility>.default        |`1`
|Specifies the default loglevel to be used for subsystems for which no specific
 loglevel is defined

|<facility>.<subsystem>    |<default>
|Log level for a specific subsystem

|<facility>.ike_name       |`no`
|Add the connection name and a unique numerical identifier for the current
 IKE_SA to each log entry if available

|<facility>.log_level      |`no`
|Add the log level of each message after the subsystem (since version 5.9.1)

|<facility>.map_level      |`-1`
|Map strongSwan specific loglevels to syslog loglevels (since version 5.9.6)

 The default setting of `-1` passes all messages to syslog using a log level of
 `LOG_INFO`. A non-negative value maps the strongSwan specific loglevels (`0..4`)
 to the syslog level starting at the specified number. For example, a value of
 `5` (`LOG_NOTICE`) maps strongSwan loglevel `0` to `LOG_NOTICE`, level `1` to
 `LOG_INFO`, and levels `2`, `3` and `4` to `LOG_DEBUG`. This allows
 (additional) filtering of log messages on the syslog server.
|===

_The placeholder `*<facility>*` is one of `*auth*` or `*daemon*`._

=== Example

An example configuration might look like this:
----
charon {

  # two defined file loggers
  filelog {
    charon {
      # path to the log file, specify this as section name in versions prior to 5.7.0
      path = /var/log/charon.log
      # add a timestamp prefix
      time_format = %b %e %T
      # prepend connection name, simplifies grepping
      ike_name = yes
      # overwrite existing files
      append = no
      # increase default loglevel for all daemon subsystems
      default = 2
      # flush each line to disk
      flush_line = yes
    }
    stderr {
      # more detailed loglevel for a specific subsystem, overriding the
      # default loglevel.
      ike = 2
      knl = 3
    }
  }

  # and two loggers using syslog
  syslog {
    # prefix for each log message
    identifier = charon-custom
    # use default settings to log to the LOG_DAEMON facility
    daemon {
    }
    # very minimalistic IKE auditing logs to LOG_AUTHPRIV
    auth {
      default = -1
      ike = 0
    }
  }
 # ...
}
----

== Compile Time Configuration

Debug statements can be stripped from the binaries during compile time. Define
`*DEBUG_LEVEL*` to the maximum level you want to include, for instance

 CFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LEVEL=1"

to include logging messages of level `*0*` and `*1*` only.

== Other Logging Backends

* xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon-systemd*`] logs to the
  xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc#_logging[systemd journal] by default.

* The xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*VICI*`] plugin provides a `*log*` event that
  delivers log messages on level 0 and 1 (xref:swanctl/swanctlLog.adoc[`*swanctl --log*`]
  subscribes to it).

* The xref:plugins/sql.adoc[`*sql*`] plugin supports logging to a database if
  enabled via `*charon.plugins.sql.loglevel*`.

* Custom plugins may register their own implementation of the `*logger_t*`
  interface ({GITHUB}/{SRC1}[`{SRC1}`]) with the bus
  ({GITHUB}/{SRC2}[`{SRC2}`]).

* In applications using `*libcharon`*, custom loggers
  ({GITHUB}/{SRC3}[`{SRC3}`]) may also be registered early from code via
  `*register_custom_logger()*` ({GITHUB}/{SRC4}[`{SRC4}`]).
  xref:daemons/charon-systemd.adoc[`*charon-systemd*`] uses this mechanism for
  its `*journald*` logger.

== Performance Considerations

Some parts of the logging system of xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] are
currently synchronized (e.g. to ensure multi-line log messages are logged together).
If performance is critical, reduce the compiled-in debugging level and reduce
loggers to a minimum. Depending on your `*syslog*` configuration, `*syslog*` calls
are very expensive if they flush everything to disk. Logging directly to a file
might be a lot faster, especially if you are running
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] on multiple cores.
