== Purpose

The `*eap-radius*` plugin for `*libcharon*` does not implement an EAP method
directly, but it redirects the EAP conversation with a client to a RADIUS backend
server. On the gateway, the EAP packets get extracted from the IKE messages and
encapsulated into the RADIUS protocol, and vice versa. The gateway itself does
not need special support for a specific EAP method, as it handles the EAP
conversation between the client and the RADIUS backend more or less transparently.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-eap-radius

== RADIUS Servers

The plugin should work with any RADIUS server. It has been tested successfully
with `FreeRADIUS` and the `NPS` Server included with `Windows Server 2008 R2`.

For EAP methods providing an `MSK` (Master Session Key) the RADIUS server must
include the `MSK` in the `*MS-MPPE-Send-Key*`/`*MS-MPPE-Receive-Key*` attributes.
Unfortunately, `FreeRADIUS` before version 2.1.10 did not include these attributes
when used with `EAP-MSCHAPv2`.

== Configuration

To let a connetion in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] use a
RADIUS backend server, define

 connections.<conn>.remote.auth = eap-radius

Configuration for the `*eap-radius*` plugin is done in the following section of
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]
----
charon {
  plugins {
    eap-radius {
      # ...
    }
  }
----

=== Basic Configuration

The plugin supports multiple RADIUS servers. To define a RADIUS backend server,
add a new section to the `*servers*` subsection with a name of your choice
----
    eap-radius {
      servers {
        server-a {
          address = 1.2.3.4
          secret = R4diu5-shared-$ecreŧ
          # nas_identifier = ipsec-gateway
        }
      }
    }
----

* The `*address*` attribute specifies the RADIUS server's IP address or DNS name.

* The `*secret*` is used to authenticate the packets exchanged with the RADIUS
  server. In untrusted networks make sure to use a strong secret with enough
  entropy because the secret might be subject to dictionary attacks.

* The `*nas_identifier*` with default [`*strongSwan*`] identifies the gateway
  against the RADIUS server and allows it to enforce a policy, for example.
  If you need an UDP port different from the RADIUS default [`*1812*`] use the
  `*port*` option.

=== Parallel RADIUS Sessions

The EAP exchange over RADIUS might need several packets and depending on the `RTT`
(Round-Trip-Time) will take several fractions of a second to complete. As a
single RADIUS client port can handle only one concurrent authentication session,
multiple client ports can be used to do parallelize authentication for high load
scenarios.

The per-server `*sockets*` option with default [`*1*`] defines the number of
pre-allocated sockets to use. A value of `*5*` allows the gateway to
authenticate 5 clients simultaneously over RADIUS.

=== Multiple RADIUS Servers

Multiple RADIUS servers can be defined for high availability or load sharing
purposes. Use additional sections in the `*servers*` subsection and configure
the individual servers accordingly.

The server used for an authentication session is selected randomly. If a server
is under load (i.e. one or more of the defined sockets are in use), the
server is degraded in the election process. If a server is unreachable it is
further degraded. From time to time a previously non-responsive server is
reused to automatically reintegrate it when it becomes available again.

=== RADIUS Server Preference

With the `*preference*` parameter of a server, priorities for specific servers
can be defined. This allows to use a secondary RADIUS server only if the first
gets unresponsive or overloaded.

A reachable server gets a priority value between `*110*` and `*210*`,
proportionally to the current use of its sockets (higher is better). Previously
unavailable servers get a value of `*0-100*`, only. The defined `*preference*`
value is added to the calculated priority. Servers with the same calculated
value will be elected randomly. The following `*preference*` values result in:

[cols="1,10"]
|===

|`*0*`   |Default, fair selection based on server load

|`*1*`   |Prefer the server, as long as it is completely unloaded

|`*50*`  |Prefer the server, unless more than half of the sockets are in use

|`*99*`  |Always prefer the server, unless no sockets are currently available

|`*101*` |Always prefer the server, unless it gets unreachable
|===

Defining a `*preference*` of `*110*` and more is not a good idea, as such a
server may always win the election process even if it is not available.

=== Session-Timeout and Dynamic Authorization Extension

A received `*Session-Timeout*` from the RADIUS backend is enforced using
{RFC4478}[Repeated Authentication].

The {RFC5176}[Dynamic Authorization Extension] allows a RADIUS backend to
actively terminate a session using a `*Disconnect-Request*` or change the
timeout of a session using a `*Session-Timeout*` attribute in a `*CoA-Request*`.
The extension is enabled using a `*dae*` subsection in the `*eap-radius*`
configuration:
----
    eap-radius {
      dae {
        enable = yes      # enable DAE extension
        listen = 0.0.0.0  # listen address, default to all
        port = 3799       # port to listen for requests, default
        secret = xxx      # shared secret to verify/sign DAE messages
      }
    }
----

=== RADIUS Attribute Forwarding

The following RADIUS attributes are forwarded to clients in corresponding
IKE configuration attributes (more details about the attributes can be found in
the docs on the xref:plugins/attr.adoc[`*attr*`] plugin):

|===

=== Arbitrary RADIUS Attribute Forwarding

Arbitrary RADIUS attributes can be forwarded from/to the IKE peer using custom
IKEv2 notify payloads. The notify uses the strongSwan specific private notify
`*40969*`. Forwarding is configured in a `*eap-radius*` subsection called
`*forward*`:
----
    eap-radius {
      forward {
        ike_to_radius = Reply-Message, 11
        radius_to_ike = 36906:12
      }
    }
----

Both options define a comma separated list of RADIUS attributes to forward in
the corresponding direction (`*ike_to_radius*` or `*radius_to_ike*`, respectively).
Attributes can be defined by name or attribute number. The number in front of a
colon defines the namespace or _Private Enterprise Number_ (`PEN`) of a
vendor-specific attribute to forward.

An IKE client can use the xref:plugins/radattr.adoc[`*radattr*`] plugin to
provide or print such attributes.

=== Identity Exchange

The `*eap-radius*` plugin starts the conversation with the RADIUS server directly
with an `*EAP-Identity*` response using the IKEv2 identity of the peer. To enforce
a different identity in this exchange, set

 connections.<conn>.remote.eap_id = test@example.com

in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. To trigger an `*EAP-Identity*`
exchange with the VPN client and ask for an EAP identity, set

 connections.<conn>.remote.eap_id = %any

Another option is to let the RADIUS server itself initiate the EAP conversation
by sending an `*EAP-Start*` message. Set

 eap_start = yes

in the `*eap-radius*` section of
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] to initiate the conversation
with `*EAP-Start*`. This kind of operation is not supported by all RADIUS servers.
Don't forget `*--enable-eap-identity*` if you use `*EAP-Identity*` exchanges
initiated by the VPN gateway.

The `*id_prefix*` option in the `*eap-radius*` section of
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] prepends a prefix to the
negotiated identity. This is useful, as some RADIUS servers interpret such a
prefix as a request for a specific EAP method (e.g. `*0*` as `*EAP-SIM*`, `*1*`
as `*EAP-AKA*`).

=== Group Selection

The plugin optionally interprets the `*class*` attribute sent in the
_Access-Accept_ message as group membership information. A
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] configuration with

 connections.<conn>.remote.groups = sales, finance

is acceptable only if the RADIUS server includes one of the two groups in the
`*class*` attribute. As this behavior is not standardized, the boolean flag

 class_group = yes

in the `*eap-radius*` plugin subsection must be set.

Alternatively, the {RFC2865}#section-5.11[`*Filter-Id*`] and
{RFC2868}#section-3.1[`*Tunnel-Type*`] attributes may be used for group selection.
If the option

 filter_id = yes

is enabled in the `*eap-radius*` plugin subsection and the
{RFC2868}#section-3.1[`*Tunnel-Type*`] attribute contains an arbitrary one-byte
tag, followed by the value `*9*` in the remaining three bytes in network order
which signifies IPsec with ESP in tunnel mode, the value of the
{RFC2865}#section-5.11[`*Filter-Id*`] attribute will be applied as group name to
the IKE_SA.

=== Examples

Here is an example configuration with two RADIUS servers defined in the
`*eap-radius*` section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan*`]
----
charon {
  plugins {
    eap-radius {
      class_group = yes
      eap_start = no
      servers {
        primary {
          address = radius1.strongswan.org
          secret = $ecreŧxyz
          nas_identifier = ipsec-gateway
          sockets = 20
          # use secondary only if overloaded/non-responsive
          preference = 99
        }
        secondary {
          address = radius2.strongswan.org
          secret = $ecreŧabc
          nas_identifier = ipsec-gateway
          sockets = 5
          # uses custom RADIUS authentication port
          port = 12345
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

== Accounting

strongSwan supports RADIUS accounting but it is disabled by default and can be
enabled using the `*accounting*` option. A non-standard port can be specified
using the `*acct_port*` option in the server section. The new `*auth_port*`
option is an alias for the `*port*` option.
----
    eap-radius {
      accounting = yes
      servers {
        server-a {
          address = 1.2.3.4
          auth_port = 1812   # default
          acct_port = 1813   # default
        }
      }
    }
----
When the `IKE SA` has been established the strongSwan VPN gateway sends an
_Accounting-Start_ request to the RADIUS server with the attributes as shown
in the example below:
----
Thu Nov 11 19:54:01 2021
        Acct-Status-Type = Start
        Acct-Session-Id = "1634624945-573"
        NAS-Port-Type = Virtual
        Service-Type = Framed-User
        NAS-Port = 573
        NAS-Port-Id = "rw"
        NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.0.150
        Called-Station-Id = "10.10.0.150[4500]"
        Calling-Station-Id = "90.166.19.115[62472]"
        User-Name = "koala.strongsec.com"
        Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.1.65
        NAS-Identifier = "strongSwan"
        Event-Timestamp = "Nov 11 2021 19:54:01 CET"
        Tmp-String-9 = "ai:"
        Acct-Unique-Session-Id = "fa1f75166d50a9845e97ad0b86d01f52"
        Timestamp = 1636656841
----
When the `IKE SA` is terminated or reauthenticated the strongSwan VPN gateway
sends an _Accounting-Stop_ request to the RADIUS server with the attributes as
shown in the example below:
----
Thu Nov 11 22:12:31 2021
        Acct-Status-Type = Stop
        Acct-Session-Id = "1634624945-573"
        NAS-Port-Type = Virtual
        Service-Type = Framed-User
        NAS-Port = 573
        NAS-Port-Id = "rw"
        NAS-IP-Address = 10.10.0.150
        Called-Station-Id = "10.10.0.150[4500]"
        Calling-Station-Id = "90.166.19.115[62472]"
        User-Name = "koala.strongsec.com"
        Framed-IP-Address = 10.10.1.65
        Acct-Output-Octets = 4074254197
        Acct-Output-Packets = 2865171
        Acct-Input-Octets = 84667320
        Acct-Input-Packets = 1257964
        Acct-Session-Time = 8310
        Acct-Terminate-Cause = User-Request
        NAS-Identifier = "strongSwan"
        Event-Timestamp = "Nov 11 2021 22:12:31 CET"
        Tmp-String-9 = "ai:"
        Acct-Unique-Session-Id = "fa1f75166d50a9845e97ad0b86d01f52"
        Timestamp = 1636665151
----
The _Accounting-Stop_ message additionally adds
{RFC2866}#section-5.7[`*Acct-Session-Time*`],
{RFC2866}#section-5.3[`*Acct-Input-Octets*`],
{RFC2866}#section-5.4[`*Acct-Output-Octets*`],
{RFC2866}#section-5.8[`*Acct-Input-Packets*`] and
{RFC2866}#section-5.9[`*Acct-Output-Packets*`].
The plugin optionally adds
{RFC2865}#section-5.25[`*Class*`] attributes received in _Access-Accept_
messages to RADIUS accounting messages.

== XAuth via RADIUS

An `*XAuth*` backend in the `*eap-radius*` plugin can directly verify `*XAuth*`
credentials using RADIUS {RFC2865}#section-5.1[`*User-Name*`] and
{RFC2865}#section-5.2[`*User-Password*`] attributes. The same set of servers is
used for both `*EAP*` and `*XAuth*` authentication and Accounting and other
RADIUS functionality can be used with `*XAuth*` as well.

To configure an IKEv1 connection on VPN gateway to verify `*XAuth*` credentials
with RADIUS, set '*auth = xauth-radius*' in a `*remote*` section:
----
connections {
  <conn>: {
    remote-rsa {
      auth = pubkey
    }
    remote-xauth {
      auth = xauth-radius
    }
    version = 1
    # ...
  }
}
----

=== Example

.strongSwan {EX4}[example] showing the use of `*XAuth*` with the `*eap-radius*` plugin
image::a-m-c.png[topology,276,190,link={EX4}]

=== Multiple Rounds

The `*eap-radius*` backend supports multiple `*XAuth*` rounds. It initiates
multiple `*XAuth*` exchanges and for each one the client shows a dialog with an
appropriate message. All replies get concatenated to the `*User-Password*`
attribute, which gets verified over RADIUS.

The number and kind of rounds is configured by so called authentication profiles.
You can have multiple profiles defined, each in its own subsection of the
`*eap-radius.xauth*` section:
----
    eap-radius {
      # ...
      xauth {
        pinprofile {
          nextpin = Please enter the next Code from your scratch list:
        }
        passandcode {
          password = Please enter your Password:
          passcode = Please enter current authenticator token code:
        }
        passandcodegerman {
          password = Bitte Passwort eingeben:
          passcode = Bitte aktuellen Code des Tokens eingeben:
        }
      }
    }
----
This example defines three `*XAuth*` profiles, the `*pinprofile*` just asking
for a PIN, the `*passandcode*` profile asking for both a password and a passcode,
and the `*passandcodegerman*` doing the same in German language. In the latter
two, the two answers get concatenated and it is up to the AAA server to correctly
verify this answer.

Valid `*XAuth*` types to request are: `*password*`, `*passcode*`, `*nextpin*`
and `*answer*`. For the strongSwan VPN gateway or the AAA server these types are
not relevant but the client may show different dialog types (along with the
configured message).

To use the configured profiles, you'll have to refer to them in the connection
definitions of xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. To do so,
append the profile name, separated by a colon, to the `*xauth-radius*` method
in the remote auth configuration:
----
connections {

  finance {
    # Certificate authentication + PIN:
    remote-pubkey {
      auth = pubkey
    }
    remote-xauth {
      auth = xauth-radius:pinprofile
    }
    version = 1
    # ...
  }

  sales {
    # Hybrid authentication with password+passcode
    remote-xauth {
      id = sales@example.com
      auth = xauth-radius:passandcode
    }
    version = 1
    # ...
  }

  sales-german {
    # Hybrid authentication with German password+passcode
    remote-xauth {
      id = sales.german@example.com
      auth = xauth-radius:passandcodegerman
    }
    version = 1
    # ...
  }
}
----
The native iOS and macOS clients are known to work fine with multiple
authentication rounds.
